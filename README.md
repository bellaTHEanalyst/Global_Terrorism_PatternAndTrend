India's COVID-19 dashboard paints a sobering picture of a nation grappling with the immense scale of the pandemic. With over 5.5 billion total confirmed cases, it's a stark reminder of the virus's relentless hold. Yet, amidst the vast numbers, lies a narrative of immense struggle, resilience, and a glimmer of hope.

73 million deaths represent the devastating human cost, each number a story of loss and heartbreak. 5 billion infections paint a picture of a nation battered by an unprecedented wave of illness. But within this darkness, we find a beacon of hope in the 5 billion individuals who have overcome the virus. This immense figure speaks of tireless frontline efforts, the strength of a nation's spirit, and the power of scientific advancements.

3 billion samples tested reveal the relentless pursuit of understanding and control. It's a testament to the dedication of healthcare workers, the adoption of testing technologies, and a collective desire to combat the invisible enemy.


## Task Description:
The COVID-19 Daily Cases dataset provides information on the daily reported COVID-19 cases, including the number ofconfirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing data. The task is to create a Power BI dashboard that offers visualizations and insights into the COVID-19 pandemics progression and impact.

**Data Source** InternCareer

. Data Import and Preparation:
- Imported the COVID-19  dataset into Power BI.
- Cleaned the data to handle any missing values and ensure consistency.
- Set up the data for time series analysis.
  
2. Daily Case Trends:
- Create visualization that displays daily trends in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries over time
 - Created visualization to display dosage administred and vaccine types

 ## ANALYSIS

While India's first COVID-19 case emerged in February 2020, its initial spread was relatively slow. By March 14, only 84 cases and 2 deaths were recorded. However, the virus soon underwent an exponential surge, climbing from hundreds to thousands, and ultimately peaking at a staggering 32 million confirmed cases on August 11. Thankfully, India boasted a high cure rate, with over 31 million recoveries. Yet, the pandemic's toll remains significant, with over 429,000 lives lost. This data paints a vivid picture of a nation battling a relentless wave of infections, punctuated by glimpses of hope and resilience in the face of immense human cost.
